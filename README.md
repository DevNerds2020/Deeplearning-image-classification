# Computer_Vision_Deep_Learning
## phase 1
- creating a simple CNN model for training on the MNIST dataset

## phase 2
- classifying images in The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset with feature extraction from pre-trained popular models including res-net, mobile-net, and google-net, and giving the extracted features to the SVM model for classification
features extracted from average pool layers are the best because they are at the end of each model 

## phase 3
- creating a simple cluster model based on the features extracted from average pool layers of popular models
